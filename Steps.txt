- create a new Add-In using the smart alert instructions (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/smart-alerts-onmessagesend-walkthrough?tabs=xmlmanifest)

- update webpack to ensure the new file "launchevent.js" is transpiled via being an entry option
  entry: {
      .....
      launchevent: "./src/launchevent/launchevent.js",
    },
  output: {
      clean: true,
      filename: "[name].js",
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    },

- delete the entry to copy over the launchevent.js directly into dest folder
  new CopyWebpackPlugin({
  patterns: [
      {
        from: "./src/launchevent/launchevent.js",
        to: "launchevent.js",
      },
    ],
  }),

- add the launchevent.js chunk to command.html file
  plugins: [
      ....
      new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
        filename: "commands.html",
        template: "./src/commands/commands.html",
        chunks: ["polyfill", "commands", "launchevent"],
      }),
  ]

- remove the script tag added to the command.html file (<script type="text/javascript" src="../launchevent/launchevent.js"></script>).
  This would be injected by webpack
